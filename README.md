<h3 align="center"><b> Welcome to the journey  ðŸ‘‹</b></h3>

<p align="center"> We often feel at a loss to describe ourselves to those who expect a pigeonholed answer. This often results in an attempt to shrink ourselves down to a singular identity. Instead, aim for a multifaceted approach. </p>
<p align="center"> We must not let pressure toward specialization interfere with our thirst for knowledge. Instead, learn to manage our behaviors through discipline to nurture our creativity. </p>
<p align="center"> Through my love of learning, I found it is best to know something by its relation to something else. This, at its essence, can be what makes all the facts amazing! </p>
<p align="center"> To see these connections, one must understand different areas of knowledge! </p>
<p align="center"> An interdisciplinary project can often offer a novel idea, concept, or approach. This can then apply across many disciplines. </p>
<p align="center"> Find something youâ€™re passionate about and keep an interest in it. Whether you're passionate about many things or one. </p>
<p align="center"> Your beliefs determine your future. Believe in yourself and your dreams, and continue pursuing your dreams and goals. </p>
<p align="center"> Trust yourself and do what you feel is right for you, let your intuition guide you. Too often we listen to the criticisms of others. </p>
<p align="center"> Donâ€™t worry about what other people think. You get to choose how you define yourself, what you care about, and where you put your energy. No one can define you but you! </p>
