<h3 align="center"><b> Welcome to the journey  ðŸ‘‹</b></h3>

<p align="center"> In order to see connections, one must understand different areas of knowledge and realize that everything connects to everything else! 
  I have found that with so many areas of interest and wanting to create something new, meaningful, and lasting; that I am, as a creative person, wanting to do the unexpected.
  It was from my love of learning, and learning how to learn, that I found it is best to know something by its relation to something else. This can be the essence of what makes all the facts become fun.
  We often feel at a loss to descrive ourselves to those who expect a pigeion-holed answer. But I think that a singular identity isn't very interesting, and that i'm a bit more multifaceted as a person than that.
  In a world pushing us more and more toward specialization, we must not let that interfer with our thirst for knowledge and range of interests and abilities. Instead, we have to learn to manage our behaviors to nurture our varied talents and interests. We need discipline to manage our behaviors and to nurture creativity. 
  Wether you are attempting an interdisciplinary project by yourself or with others, you can often take an idea, concept, or approach from one dicipline and apply it to another. 
  Find something you're passianate about and keep tremendously interest in it. Even if your passionate about many things or just one. 
  With a can-do attitude and a belief that you can do anything if you want to, you can transform from a jack of all trades to a master of many! Because, if you think you have ability or talent in one way, you have it in all ways. 
  Your future is determined by your beliefs. Believe in yourself and your dreams, and continue pursuing your dreams/goals. 
  Trust yourself and do what you feel is right for you, let your intuition guid you. Too often we listen to the critisizms of others. Just remember that regardless of which path you choose, there will always be someone critisizing you, so take the path that is right for you. 
  Don't worry about what other people think. You get to choos how you define yourself, what you care about, and where you put your energy. Let go of the labels others give you and define yourself. Dont worry about what anyone else thinks, says, or how they want to label you. No one can define you but you.
